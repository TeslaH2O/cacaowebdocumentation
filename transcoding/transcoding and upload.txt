  SETTING UP A TRANSCODING AND UPLOADING SERVER FOR CACAOWEB
  
  
  This document explains how to set up your transcoding server, the following procedure is 
  given as an example that you can adapt to your own needs.
  Once files are transcoded, they need to be uploaded to the cacaoweb network, which is 
  also explained in this document.

  
  
    WHY TRANSCODE VIDEOS?
  
    Even though there is no restriction with what can play cacaoweb files, users feel more
	comfortable with using the Flash player. 
	The Flash player currently supports 2 formats, mp4 and flv.
	Both format are supported by cacaoweb, however flv currently allows for more 
	flexibility than mp4.
	Therefore it is usually preferable to transcode the files into the flv container format.
	
	
	
	HOW TO TRANSCODE?
	
	  1. Server setup
	    
		- any flavor of linux, preferably 64bits.
		- lots of RAM and CPU, multicores are welcome.
		
		software:
		- ffmpeg and x264 (install from the latest sources)
		- yamdi (install from the latest sources)
		- curl
		
		
		How to install ffmpeg and x264?
		This guide is quite good: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786095
		But probably only applies to Ubuntu or Debian.
		Make sure you get the ffmpeg and x264 versions from their git repositories
		
		
	  2. Transcoding files
	    
		The script "convert.sh" handles the conversion.
		You use this script as follows:
		
		# ./convert.sh myfilename.mkv
		
		at the command prompt, where myfilename.mkv is the file you want to transcode.
		
		
		Here is a rough explanation of how it works:
		
		1) the script convert.sh creates a temporary directory and copies the source file in there
		2) we do a 2-pass encoding on the file, with a target bitrate of 850 (good for 720p quality,
		   but for lower quality you can target 500)
		3) metadata is added to the result with yamdi
		4) directory is cleaned up
		
		
	
	
	HOW TO UPLOAD?
	
	  Once your file is transcoded, you need to upload it to the cacaoweb network.
	  To do this, you need to have an instance of cacaoweb running on your server, then call
	  cacaoweb through its http api so it will upload the file.
	  
	  1. Launch cacaoweb
	  
	  You can launch cacaoweb like this:
	  
	  ./cacaoweb.linux
	  
	  
	  2. Upload the file
	  
	  You can call the http API to upload the file like this:
	  
	  # curl http://localhost:4001/upload?filepath=/myfiles/myfilename.flv&restricted=false&previewallowed=false
	  
	  
	  Please refer to http://www.cacaoweb.org/api/docs/cacaoweb_http_api.html
	  
	  Your file will be uploaded in a p2p fashion.
	  
	  
	  3. Check the upload status
	  
	  You can call the following function from the http API to query the upload status:
	  
	  # curl http://localhost:4001/uploads
	  
	  It provides a list of all uploads with an XML format.
