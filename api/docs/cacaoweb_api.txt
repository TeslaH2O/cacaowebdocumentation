  HOW TO CALL THE API FUNCTIONS

    The API is called through http calls on the cacaoweb http server.
	
	For example, to get the current version of the running cacaoweb instance:
	  # curl http://localhost:4001/version
	"curl" can be replaced by "wget" or any http-aware client.
	It can also be called within a browser by pasting the url in the address bar.
	
	All the API functions can be called through a url like the following:
	  http://localhost:4001/[name_of_the_api_function]

  UPLOADING
  
    1. Direct Upload
	  
	  Direct upload means that the file will be uploaded from your computer to the cacaoweb network without any intermediary.
	  It is uploaded in p2p fashion to the cacaoweb network and thus the progress is not linear like with a standard upload to a server.
	  It also takes a longer time to upload a file in p2p (however downloads can be a lot faster in p2p).
	
	  * Basic Usage
	  
	  
		- to upload a local file:
		  
		/upload?filepath=PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE
		  
		where PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE is the full path to the file you want to upload
	  
	  
		- to get progress for the current uploads:
		
		/uploads
		
		this gives you a list of current uploads in XML format
		
		
		- to remove an upload (for example once the progress has reached 100%):
		
		/removeupload?f=MD5_OF_THE_FILE
		
		where MD5_OF_THE_FILE is the md5 of the file, given by the /uploads function
